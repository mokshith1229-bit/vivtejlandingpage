## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This project uses a "Cosmic SaaS" aesthetic. Key design tokens include:
- Deep indigo and midnight blue backgrounds (`#0A0B1A`).
- Vibrant gradients (Emerald, Amber, Rose, Indigo) used for abstract blurs and highlights.
- `preserve-3d` CSS properties for tilting mockups and parallax scrolling effects.
- Glassmorphism overlays with `backdrop-blur`.
